"""Time complexity : O(N). Although there are nested loops, the inner loop is bounded to be run at most k times globally.
Together with the outer loop, we have the exact (N + k) number of operations. Since 0 < k â‰¤ N, the time complexity of
the main loop is bounded within 2N. For the logic outside the main loop, it is clear to see that their time complexity is
O(N). As a result, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(N)

Space complexity : O(N). We have a stack which would hold all the input digits in the worst case.
